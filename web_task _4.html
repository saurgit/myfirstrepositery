        <p>
            Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907 â€“ 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary, professing socialism and atheism, whose two acts of violence against the British in India,
             hunger-strike in jail, and execution made him a folk hero in India. His martyrdom electrified an underlying militancy in India,
             and prompted urgent action within the Indian National Congress's eventually successful non-violent campaign for India's independence.

            In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation,
             for the British police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate.
             They believed Scott was responsible for 
            the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai by having ordered a lathi charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a police station on a motorcycle,
             he was felled by a single bullet fired from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman. As he lay injured, he was shot at close range several times by Singh, the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds. Another associate of Singh,
              Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police head constable, Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase to Singh and Rajguru as they fled.
