     <h2>Childhood & Early Life</h2>
<p class="ad">
    Chandra Shekhar  Azad was born Chandra Shekhar  Tiwari, to Pandit Sita Ram Tiwari and Jagrani Devi on July 23, 1906
     in Bhavra village in Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh. Chandra Shekhar grew up with Bhils who inhabited the area and learnt wrestling,
      swimming along with archery. He was an ardent follower of Lord Hanuman from a young age. He practiced javelin throwing and developed 
      an enviable physique. He received his early schooling in Bhavra. For higher studies he went to a Sanskrit Pathashala in Varanasi.

 <h2>Revolutionary Activities</h2>
<p class="sd">
    The Jallianwallah Bagh Massacre took place in 1919 and the brutal deed of British oppression had reverberating effect on the
     Indian Nationalist movement. The blatant disregard exhibited by the British towards basic human rights and unnecessary use of
      violence on a group of unarmed and peaceful people, incited a burst of hatred from the Indians directed towards the British Raj. 
      The nation was gripped by this anti-British euphoria and Chandra Shekhar was part of a group of young revolutionaries who dedicated
       their lives towards a single goal – securing freedom for his beloved motherland by driving the British away from India.
</p> <h2>Martyrdom</h2>
<p class="ad sd">Azad’s impact on the British Raj law enforcement faction was evident from how much effort they put to capture him,
     dead or alive. They even announced a reward of Rs. 30,000 on his head. The huge amount of money led to vital information on the 
     whereabouts of Azad. On February 27, 1931 Chandrashekhar Azad was meeting with friends at Alfred Park, Allahabad. A pre-informed police 
     surrounded the park and asked Chandrashekhar Azad to surrender. Azad fought valiantly to allow his friends safe passage and killed three
      policemen. Though his shooting skills were immensely sharp, he started receding and was badly injured. After nearly exhausting his 
      ammunition and foreseeing no means of escape, he shot himself in the head with his last bullet. He upheld his vow never to be captured
       by the British. </p>
